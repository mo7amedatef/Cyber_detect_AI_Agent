# Incident Report
## Executive Summary
A high-risk security incident has been identified, with a risk score of 85/100. The threat analysis is currently pending, and immediate action is required to contain and mitigate the potential impact. This report outlines the findings and provides a recommended action plan to address the incident.

## Detailed Findings
The following findings have been identified:
* **Initial Access**: Unknown ( pending analysis )
* **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)**: Not yet mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework due to incomplete analysis
* **Risk Score**: 85/100, indicating a high-risk incident
* **Threats**: 
  + Analysis: Pending

Given the incomplete analysis, it is essential to expedite the threat analysis to determine the specific TTPs used by the adversary. Potential relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques that may be applicable include:
* **Initial Access** (TA0001): Techniques used to gain initial access to the network, such as phishing, exploitation of public-facing applications, or external remote services
* **Execution** (TA0002): Techniques used to execute malicious code, such as command and script interpreters or application access token

## Recommended Action Plan
### Immediate Containment Steps
To minimize the potential impact of the incident, the following immediate containment steps are recommended:
1. **Isolate affected systems**: Immediately isolate any systems that may be affected by the incident to prevent further lateral movement.
2. **Activate incident response team**: Assemble the incident response team to coordinate efforts and ensure a unified response.
3. **Gather logs and evidence**: Collect relevant logs and evidence from affected systems to support further analysis.
4. **Conduct preliminary analysis**: Perform a preliminary analysis of the available data to identify potential TTPs and inform the next steps.
5. **Notify stakeholders**: Inform relevant stakeholders, including management, IT teams, and potentially affected parties, about the incident and the ongoing response efforts.

### Next Steps
Once the immediate containment steps have been taken, the following next steps are recommended:
* Complete the threat analysis to determine the specific TTPs used by the adversary
* Develop a comprehensive incident response plan, including eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities
* Conduct a thorough investigation to identify the root cause of the incident and implement measures to prevent similar incidents in the future

By following this recommended action plan, the organization can effectively respond to the incident, minimize the potential impact, and reduce the risk of similar incidents occurring in the future.
